# Interactive Virtual Pet

## Goals
The goal of this project is to understand how micro-controller works.

## Description
I’m using the Pro Trinket, instead of an Arduino. It’s big enough to fit the 3D print enclosure and powerful enough to run the project.

I call it “Virtual Pet” since it’s actually a pet. It responses to taps and vibration and shows 4 different emotions (neutral, sad, happy, angry) on its LED matrix face.

In normal circumstance, it gazes around blinks, plays spontaneous tones and patterns that correspond to its emotional state. It smiles when you play with its enough. If left alone for too long it gets lonely, but pester your pet too much and it may get angry.

This is the video that I document when building this pet: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/8Vz3GWp3P4Q)

## Difficulties:
1. 3D print is not smooth enough to fit the screws so I use the hot glue instead.
2. Soldering, wiring and putting thing together in a small enclosure is hard because it is very easy to break the connection.
3. The author's source code is pretty complex so I need to refactor everything for scalable purpose in the future.

## Future plan:
1. Build up a real robots with other movable body parts.
2. More Artificial Intelligence algorithms to make it more sensitive to the outside world.
3. ESP Wifi and Bluetooth connection
4. Talk to phone, control with phone.
